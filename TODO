drawing:
- width controls (calligraphy)
- mirroring

surface:
- bump maps
- clouds (fractal-controlled noise)
- noise
- squiggle (how do you do this?)
- brushed metal (horizontally blurred noise?)
- wood (is this worth trying to generate? squiggled brushed metal?)
- leather (squiggled and blurred hexagons?)

factoring:
- tools for image compositing/slicing (capture_image, etc)
- layer stuff
- permutations (variations)
- better syntax for parameter variations
- better manipulation of paths (rounding, etc)
